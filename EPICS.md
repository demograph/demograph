# TODO

This list serves as our central list of large problems for which we need
an initial solution, good enough to bootstrap the feedback loop.

## Open cloud service

An open cloud service is one that is open-source, provides free public
services, and is hosted as a P2P application. No altruism is assumed of
peers. Their computational resources serve their own interest, but are
shared to the extent that is collectively rational. In general, peers
are expected to make an effort to have minimal impact on the rest of the
network.

*CLAIM*: Demograph must be an open cloud application

- Scalability: The power of Demograph is in the aggregation of billions
 of statements and relations and to form (probably multiple) collective
 mental models. Significant computational power is required to do so,
 which doesn't come for free.
- Resilience and graceful degradation: A large number of peers allows
for fine-grained redundancy, and linking the likelihood of failure to
the relative importance of an application feature.
- Verifiability: It is difficult to verify whether closed systems
behave correctly uphold ethical/moral values we hold. An open cloud
does not solve all of those problems. However, when open-source gets
combined with open sharing of information, which includes the inputs
and outputs to algorithms, then those computations can be verified.
- Control: Applications that serve the general interest should be under
control of the general population. Placing the responsibility in the
hands of a single central authority provides a weakest link for
manipulating what the service does.

### Bootstrapping P2P systems

P2P systems designers all face the same problem, how do we allow new
clients to join our system, without introducing a centralized system
for rendez-vous?

## Identity

We require identities both for human and computational agents. These are
required for building a web of trust. In addition, human identities are
required for annotating objective models, see Mental models.

## Mental models

Central to demograph is the separation of an objective model and a
subjective model. The objective model can contain objects, propositions
and relations. The subjective model annotates objects, propositions
and relations in an objective model with agent-specific propositions.
Agent-specific propositions form the input for algorithms that derive
collective mental models from them. These include, but are not limited
to; clustering of desires, best-fitting collective belief, validation
of collective intention with its decomposition in individual intentions.

In effect, our mental models are agent-qualified mental state
annotations on top of more traditional objective models.

## Deliberation

Deliberation is a special, but important case for expressing belief, in
 that it allows one to criticize the truthfulness of statements or
 validity of arguments.

## Reputation systems
