# Demograph

## Ambition

Demograph is a platform that has the ambition of raising collective
rationality by facilitating mental alignment. It gives individuals the 
opportunity to make their mental models explicit in terms of desires, 
beliefs and intentions. Those individual mental models are then used to 
derive collective mental models using open-source algorithms that are
improved in a collaborative way. This approach provides a feedback loop
for mental models between individuals, but similarly between the
collective model and the algorithm used to derive it.

## Main Objective

Clearly, this is an ambitious undertaking. Demographs _main_ priority is
to be the _minimal_ viable product to bootstrap the feedback-loop. i.e.
it facilitates a basic level of mental alignment, sufficient at least
for collective introspection on the development of demograph itself.

## Methodology

- Decompose the large problem into sub-problems; gain experience by 
developing minimal solutions for the sub-problems. Construct interfaces
such that partial solutions compose into a larger solution. Rewrite
 partial solutions (from scratch if need be) to fit the interface.
- Experiment with people in the know, acquire both expert opinion and
user feedback.
- Rince and repeat?
